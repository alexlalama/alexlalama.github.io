                My name is Alex. I am studying Computing and Information Technology at Rochester Institute of Technology. Specifically, I found an interest in systems administration, web development and programming. 
                <br/><br/><br/>
                When school is not in session, I tend to visit home in New Jersey to visit family and friends. I enjoy reading, going for walks, and continuing my hobbies.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                This page features in-depth detail on the classes I have taken, my work experience, coding projects, my hobbies, and my contact information.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                After graduating from my undergraduate studies, I plan to grow my network, pursue my hobbies, and continue my life-long journey of learning.
