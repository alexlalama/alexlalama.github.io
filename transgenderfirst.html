Especially those who are apart of the LGBTQ+ community, college can be extremely overwhelming and nerve wrecking. Being transgender can be scary attending a space where you do not know what others think of the LGBTQ+ community or of being a different gender. Unknown spaces like these create unnecessary tension for just wanting to be your true self and express your identity in the way you feel most comfortable. These spaces not only include classrooms but are eating areas, gyms, and housing.

        Transgenders in many religious colleges are denied within their application as these schools do not accept them although they might show great academic achievements. We should not be limited in our education because of our identity. Using pronouns within colleges is one way colleges are making their spaces more inclusive, but unfortunately this is not the case in the whole country. Housing and social spaces can also be intimidating and new to us. Another aspect that is difficult for transgender individuals are the use of bathrooms. Although in some colleges there are gender neutral or all gender restrooms, this is not available in every state, every college or every building. With not having the money to afford colleges, individuals might choose different colleges based on their costs even if there views are unsafe which may have a huge effect on their mental health and wellbeing. We might feel isolated and alienated in colleges that have unaccepting views that force us to spend time alone and feel judged. College is supposed to be an accepting, welcoming, fun new environment for all.

        For me individually I am anxious about living in a space unaware of their beliefs and character. I struggle with making friends as I do not know when to bring up my identity or address this conversation of uniqueness in  general. Attending college will be difficult for me socially and financially where applying to this scholarship will not only give me the ability to attend to a university that is more accepting of me but allow me to have the funds to have access to housing I feel most comfortable and safe in. A lot of these difficulties within housing, restrooms, and social areas are ones I am most timid to engage in, but I am confident in finding a friend group who appreciate me for myself.
