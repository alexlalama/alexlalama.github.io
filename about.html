    <p id ="about">
        As you probably know, my name is Alex Lalama. I currently live in New
        Jersey. I currently attend Middlesex County College and study CS in a concentration of Network and Administration Support. If you would like to read more about my courses and previous education please visit my <a href="education.html">Education</a> page.

        I have an interest in digitally producing music and learning new things.
        After college, I aim to work in the tech or music industry where I can
        expand my design skills within coding, using DAWS, and instruments. To
        find more about my specific hobbies and what I have created you can
        visit my <a href="#hobbiesSection">Hobbies</a> section.
