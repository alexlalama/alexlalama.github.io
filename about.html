        As you probably know, my name is Alex Lalama. I currently live in New
        Jersey and have a ton of hobbies including producing music, reading,
        drawing, coding, and enjoying nature. I currently attend Rutgers
        University. If you would like to read more about my courses, professors,
        and previous education such as where I transferred from before Rutgers,
        please visit my <a href="education.html">Education</a> page.

        I have an interest in digitally producing music and learning new things.
        After college, I aim to work in the tech or music industry where I can
        expand my design skills within coding, using DAWS, and instruments. To
        find more about my specific hobbies and what I have created you can
        visit my <a href="hobbies.html">Hobbies</a> page.
