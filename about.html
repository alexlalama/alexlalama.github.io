    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        As you probably know, my name is Alex Lalama. I currently live in New
        Jersey and have a ton of hobbies including producing music, reading,
        drawing, coding, and enjoying nature. I currently attend Rutgers
        University. If you would like to read more about my courses, professors,
        and previous education such as where I transferred from before Rutgers,
        please visit my <a href="#educationSection">Education</a> section.
        <br><br>
        I have an interest in digitally producing music and learning new things.
        After college, I aim to work in the tech or music industry where I can
        expand my design skills within coding, using DAWS, and instruments. To
        find more about my specific hobbies and what I have created you can
        visit my <a href="#hobbiesSection">Hobbies</a> section.
